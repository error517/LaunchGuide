LaunchPilot MVP: Project Specification & Development Plan1. OverviewProject Goal: To build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for LaunchPilot, a tool designed to provide structured, prescriptive marketing guidance for early-stage technical founders with limited marketing knowledge.Core Hypothesis to Validate: "Will technical founders, lacking marketing knowledge, find significant value in, understand, and act upon a structured, prescriptive marketing guidance tool inspired by Traction's principles, leading them to initiate concrete channel testing activities?"MVP Focus: Deliver a credible, actionable initial marketing mini-plan based on user input and guide the user through the very first steps of executing that plan for 1-2 selected channels.2. Target UserPrimary: Technical founders of early-stage startups (pre-product-market fit).Characteristics: Strong technical skills, comfortable with programming concepts, but self-identifies as a beginner in marketing strategy and execution. Likely resource-constrained (time and/or money). Needs clear, actionable, non-overwhelming guidance.3. Functional Requirements (Features)The MVP will include the following core features:F1: Guided Business Input (Onboarding)A simple, multi-step form or single-page form to collect essential context.Inputs:Basic product/service description (textarea).Target audience definition (simplified persona sketch - text input).Primary initial business goal (dropdown/select: e.g., first 10 paying customers, 100 beta users, validate problem).Rough budget constraints (dropdown/select: e.g., <$500/month, time-only).Self-assessment of marketing knowledge (dropdown/select: e.g., beginner, some familiarity).Data Persistence: User inputs must be saved to the database.F2: Simplified Channel Brainstorming/SuggestionPresent a curated list of 8-10 marketing channels relevant to early-stage tech startups (e.g., Content Marketing, SEO (Basic), Community Building (Reddit/Indie Hackers), Cold Outreach (Limited), BetaList/Product Hunt Launch, Targeted Social Ads (Simple), etc.).Provide brief (1-2 sentence) explanations for each channel.Allow the user to select a subset of 3-5 channels they feel are potentially viable based on their inputs and the descriptions.(Optional - Future Enhancement): Light AI suggestion based on inputs (Out of scope for initial MVP build).Data Persistence: The user's selected channels must be saved.F3: Guided Prioritization (Mini-Bullseye Simulation)An interactive interface to help the user rank their selected 3-5 channels.Guidance prompts or simple criteria displayed to help ranking:Estimated potential reach/impact (relative scale: High, Medium, Low).Estimated cost (relative scale: Time-Heavy, Low Budget, Moderate Budget).Required skills/effort level (relative scale: Beginner-Friendly, Moderate Effort, Requires Learning).Goal: User selects the top 1 or 2 channels for initial testing.Data Persistence: The final prioritized 1-2 channels must be saved.F4: Actionable Mini-Plan GenerationThe core output of the MVP.Based on the 1-2 prioritized channels selected in F3.Generates a highly specific, step-by-step initial action plan for each selected channel.Plans must be designed for a complete beginner, breaking down actions into the smallest feasible first steps (as per user examples: Content Marketing keyword -> outline -> draft; Community Building find subreddit -> observe -> engage non-promotionally).Include links to simple external resources (e.g., free keyword tools, writing guides) where appropriate.Data Persistence: The generated plan(s) must be saved.F5: Basic Progress TrackingDisplay the generated mini-plan(s) to the user.Allow users to mark individual steps within their plan(s) as 'Done' (e.g., via checkboxes or buttons).Provide clear visual feedback when a step is marked as done.Data Persistence: The completion status of each step must be saved.F6: Integrated Learning (Jargon Explanation)Identify common marketing terms within the UI (channel names, plan steps, criteria).Provide simple ways to get definitions (e.g., tooltips on hover, info icons (?) that reveal definitions on click).Definitions should be concise and beginner-friendly.4. Non-Functional RequirementsUsability: The interface should be clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate for the target user. Focus on clarity over complex design initially.Responsiveness: Basic responsiveness to ensure usability on standard desktop screen sizes. Mobile optimization is a secondary concern for the initial MVP but should not be completely broken. Use Tailwind's responsive utilities where easy.Data Persistence: All user-generated data (inputs, selections, plan status) must be reliably stored in the database.Performance: The application should load reasonably fast. Next.js defaults help here.5. Technology StackFramework: Next.js (with App Router)Language: TypeScriptStyling: Tailwind CSSDatabase: MongoDB (using MongoDB Atlas free tier recommended)Deployment (Initial): Vercel (recommended, free tier available, integrates seamlessly with Next.js)6.
